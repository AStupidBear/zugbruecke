Speed
=====

zugbruecke performs reasonably well given its complexity with **less than 0.2 Âµs
overhead per call** in average on modern hardware.

The inter-process communication via multiprocessing connection adds overhead to
every function call. Because zugbruecke takes care of packing and unpacking of
pointers and structure for arguments and return values, this adds another bit of overhead.
Calls are slow in general, but the first call of an individual routine within
a session is even slower due to necessary initialization happening beforehand.
Depending on the use-case, instead of working with zugbruecke, it will be significantly
faster to isolate functionality depending on DLL calls into a dedicated Python
script and run it directly with a Windows Python interpreter under Wine.

For comparison and overhead measurements, see the following numbers:

Benchmarks were performed with an i7 3740QM CPU, Linux kernel 4.4.72, Wine 2.10,
CPython 3.6.1 x86-64 for Linux and CPython 3.5.3 x86-32 for Windows. zugbruecke was
configured with log level 0 (logs off) for minimal overhead.
